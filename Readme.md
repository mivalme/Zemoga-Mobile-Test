* iOS Deployment Target:  _iOS 12.0_

### Third-party library ‚å®Ô∏è

__Lottie__

_Lottie is a native iOS, Android, and React library that processes After Effects animations in real time, 
allowing applications to use animations as easily as they use static images. 
So it has become a benchmark for including animations in native applications. 
In addition, the files it processes to run the animation are very light (.json)._
